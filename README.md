# client-sb-admin2-angular

This is a port of [Start Bootstrap Admin 2 theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/) to a simple [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) base. We've tried to retain as much as possible the original libraries and their respective code structures designed by the cool people at [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) (kudos to them). The modifications we made were to aim at these main goals:

1. Make the whole SB Admin 2 theme run smoothly on AngularJS
2. Have our own build script based entirely on `npm` instead of relying on `grunt` or `gulp` or the likes (yes, it's an ego thing, but [we're not alone](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/)).

### Caveats

Please excuse us for not having enough resources to battle-test this build on all available environments. Here is a list of the environments under which we've built successfully:

- Mac OS Yosemite
